/*

The world exists on a globe and I intend for the player to be able to seemlessely translate between
the very left and right of the map. In order to accomplish this, the x position is going to be
stored as a unit vector. This reduces the complexity of distance operations and other position
functions in order to avoid messy code involving any kind of wrapping.
